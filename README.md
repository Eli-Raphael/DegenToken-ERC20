To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE.

Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ then create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Before compiling, copy and paste this code:

```javascript


```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the Compile "DegenToken.sol" button.

Before deploying, make sure that your environment is set to Injected Provider-Metamask. 

There are also a few configurations that you must make before you proceed.

Use these settings on the website: https://core.app/en/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c
Select network: Fuji (C-Chain)
Select token: AVAX
Address: (The address of your metamask account)
Coupon Code: avaxstrong (optional)

Once the code is compiled, click "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ERC20 Token.sol" contract from the dropdown menu, type in the name that you want for the contract and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Upon deployment you will be asked to confirm connection by metamask, just click confirm. 

Proceed to the dropdown of the contract you have created, click the functions to run them. You will see if they worked in the terminal, another way of verifying is by going to https://testnet.snowtrace.io/.

To check your transactions, copy the address of your contract and paste it on the search bar of https://testnet.snowtrace.io/. There you will see creation of the contract and the methods used.
